## Privacy and Telemetry Notice

When you deploy/run this software, it regularly submits usage/metering data to the Microsoft Azure Metering API; in fact that's its main reason to exist. It is supposed to aggregate your customer's software usage information, and to submit it to `https://marketplaceapi.microsoft.com` (or `https://saasapi.azure.com`, which seems to be the more modern hostname for the metering API).  *If you don't want that, don't use it.* You can't turn that off via configuration.

Besides that, it does **not** send any telemetry, error reporting, etc., to Microsoft. 

For Microsoft in general, you can find our privacy statement at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704.

# 2022-02-11 09:10:07 Marketplace Metering Guidance.

This article describes an architectural pattern for properly and reliably aggregating consumption of Azure Marketplace offers and submitting it to the Azure Marketplace Metering API. 

The Azure Marketplace Metering Service allows ISVs to enable Azure Marketplace offers such as Azure Managed Applications or Software-as-a-Service applications to charge for consumption, according to custom billing dimensions, as defined by the ISV. As an ISV, you need to run a system which keeps track of the consumption in your application and submits the relevant usage to the Azure Metering Service, in an aggregated and timely fashion. 

ISV solutions report to the metering API that a certain customer subscription in the marketplace (who) consumed a specific amount of units (how much), of a certain billing dimension (what), in a given hour (when). The metering API accepts batches of up to 25 of these usage events to be submitted at once. 

Many ISV solutions share a common set of challenges: As a developer, you certainly want to concentrate on your solution's functionality, and not spend much effort on understanding how the Azure Marketplace's metering needs to get your customer's usage information. Azure Marketplace offers with custom dimensions allow for sophisticated business models, which increase the complexity of the solution's billing logic. 

For example, for a given billing dimension, a Marketplace offer might have 'included quantities' for the monthly and/or annual term. It is up to the ISV's solution to correctly track and account for these included quantities. The ISV must only report customer usage *above* these included quantities, i.e., only overage must be reported to Microsoft. In addition, at the time a customer's billing cycle renews, the ISV's accounting system needs to 're-fill' the customer's included quantities. 

The metering API requires ISV solutions to report usage in a timely fashion. The API only accepts usage events which belong to the last 24 hours; older usage events are rejected by the API. Therefore, the ISV's accounting and usage reporting solution needs to reliably and continuously submit usage; running an accounting job once a week is not sufficient. At the same time, the solution certainly doesn't need to run 24x7, as long as it submits data a couple of times a day.

The metering API requires usage data to be aggregated on an hourly basis. The ISV solution cannot simply forward all relevant metering events to the metering API when the occur. Instead, usage must be accumulated over an hour, properly handling potentially remaining included quantities, and only submit the overage usage to the metering API, for a past hour, that the customer really has to pay for.

Last, but not least, the metering API only accepts a single 'first write' for a certain combination of marketplace subscription, billing dimension, and hour. Once the ISV solution reported that a certain consumption happened, subsequent submissions for the same subscription/dimension/timeslot will be rejected as a duplicate. The "first write wins", and the customer will be charged accordingly; there is no mechanism to correct/update a previously submitted value.
